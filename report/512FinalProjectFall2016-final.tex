\textnormal{
Recommendation system can be used in many commercial areas, e.g. food market, travel market and moive industry. In this project, a graph-based algorithm for a recommendation system is developed combining with collaborative filtering and item-based methond . We compute the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. The results shows that...
